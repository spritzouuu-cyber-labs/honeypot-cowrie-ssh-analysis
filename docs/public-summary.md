# Public Summary â€” Cowrie SSH Honeypot

This project documents a **safe and isolated honeypot** to observe real attack attempts on SSH in order to build skills in threat analysis and defensive monitoring.

**What is implemented**
- Cowrie honeypot (SSH emulation)
- Network isolation + egress lockdown
- Collection of logs for analysis (only anonymized data will be published)

**Why this matters**
This demonstrates practical skills in:
- attack surface exposure and hardening
- log collection and interpretation (blue team mindset)
- structured documentation for stakeholders

A full analysis will be provided in `analysis/report.md` when enough data is collected.
